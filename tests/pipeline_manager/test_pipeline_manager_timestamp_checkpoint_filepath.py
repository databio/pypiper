        Checkpoint files within sample folder include pipeline name.

        More specifically, we often have the case that a single sample's
        name is the name of a subfolder, within the broader results
        directory for an entire project, in which to store output files
        associated with that particular sample. The sample in that case may
        be associated with a protocol that maps to multiple pipelines, and
        thus the sample may be processed by multiple pipelines. If each
        pipeline had a unique set of stage names, we'd be fine with no
        additional measures, but to avoid a checkpoint filename collision,
        in which we would be unable to know which pipeline had generated
        a given checkpoint file, we add the pipeline name to the checkpoint
        file and assume that we're not processing the sample with multiple
        identically named pipelines.
